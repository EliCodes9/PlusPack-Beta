[DISCLAIMERS]

I did not make any of these mods, i have just combined them, and provided compatibility layers.

Does not work with fabric, liteloader, or optifine. use forge on java 8.

This modpack is in beta, I am not responsible for any issues caused by using this, however i will try to provide solutions.

Email elicampbell09@gmail.com for any issues, bugs, suggestions, ETC.

[FOOTNOTE]

Hope you enjoy!
